These include negative impacts connected \r\nwith the undertaking\u2019s own operations and its upstream and downstream \r\nvalue chain, including through its products or services, as well as \r\nthrough its business relationships. Due diligence is an on-going \r\npractice that responds to and may trigger changes in the undertaking\u2019s \r\nstrategy, business model, activities, business relationships, operating,\r\n sourcing and selling contexts.

Where the undertaking cannot address all \r\nimpacts at once, the due diligence process allows for action to be \r\nprioritised based on the severity and likelihood of the impacts.
