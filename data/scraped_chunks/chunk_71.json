The European Commission's EU strategy on adaptation to climate change is accompanied by a Staff Working Document.ICTThe challenges posed by climate change for the ICT fall into two main categories: acute events and chronic stresses. Acute events (also termed critical or crisis events) include floods (pluvial, fluvial, coastal), ice storms, heatwaves, etc. Acute events compromise ICT infrastructures by destroying or disabling the physical assets that they depend on. Chronic stresses result from more gradual changes in climate norms, such as including changes in temperature ranges and humidity levels. While these impacts are less likely to have catastrophic consequences, they will lead to increased asset degradation, more frequent failures and shorter life spans.Land use planningLand use planning is identified as one of the most effective processes to facilitate local adaptation to climate change.
