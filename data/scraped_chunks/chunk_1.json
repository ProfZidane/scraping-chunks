These data are used for production and validation of Copernicus products and are also provided to users as observations in their own right.Image storyImageIza\u00f1a Atmospheric Observatory: Conchy BAYO. Land cover map: SIOSE. Copernicus and its In-Situ ComponentIn-situ data, namely observations and geospatial reference data, are crucial for the generation, calibration and validation of satellite data, products and services of Copernicus, the Earth Observation component of the EU Space Programme.Copernicus is the European Union\u2019s revolutionary Earth Observation component of the EU Space Programme. It transforms information from multiple sources, including the Sentinel satellites and in-situ observations, into operational services for keeping watch over the planet \u2013 from the land to the ocean, atmosphere and climate.For its operations, Copernicus relies on ground-based, air and sea borne monitoring systems, geospatial and ancillary data from a range of providers. These  data constitute the \"Copernicus In-Situ Component\" and complement and calibrate satellite information to increase product accuracy, reduce delivery time and support validation.The Cross-Cutting Coordination of the Copernicus In-Situ Component, led by the European Environment Agency (EEA), maps the availability of data and identifies gaps or bottlenecks in access. It also supports the provision of cross-cutting data and information, and manages partnerships with data providers to improve access and use.In-situ data in Copernicus and its governanceIn-situ data in Copernicus covers two main categories: Observations and Geospatial data. It also encompasses Fiducial Reference Measurements, which are very precise ground measurements used to validate satellite data. More about In-Situ dataThe Copernicus In-Situ Component is based on a very wide and complex data providers and networks landscape, typically national, regional and global data providers. While the Copernicus Entrusted Entities\u00a0are in charge of accessing in-situ data directly to meet their day-to-day operational needs, the European Environment Agency (EEA) is in charge of the cross-cutting coordination of Copernicus\u2019 access to in-situ data, maintains an overview of in-situ data requirements by the Entrusted Entites and proposes and implements solutions to make more essential in-situ data available to Copernicus as a whole.Discover how EEA is leading Copernicus In-Situ Image by: ICOS RI/Rocco Canella", "Entites and proposes and implements solutions to make more essential in-situ data available to Copernicus as a whole.Discover how EEA is leading Copernicus In-Situ Image by: ICOS RI/Rocco Canella (Lampedusa station, Italy)Explore the Copernicus In-Situ componentState of PlayCopernicus Data ProvidersUse CasesLibraryBackground image by: ICOS RI/Pekka Pelkonen (Gebesee station, Germany)NewsLoadingMore newsCopernicus ServicesAtmosphereMarineLandSecurityClimate ChangeEmergencySign up to In Situ updatesSubscribeFollow usCopernicusCopernicus is the Earth Observation component of the European Union's space programme, looking at our planet and its environment for the benefit of Europe's citizens.Privacy statementSitemapCMS LoginAccessibilitytop", "European Environment Agency's home pageSkip to main contentSkip to navigationSkip to footerAn official website of the European Union | How do you know?All official European Union website addresses are in the europa.eu domain.See all EU institutions and bodiesEnvironmental information systemsEuropean Environment Agency websiteWISE marine - Marine information system for EuropeWISE freshwater - Freshwater information system for EuropeBISE - Biodiversity information system for EuropeFISE - Forest information system for EuropeEuropean Climate and health observatoryClimateADAPTEuropean Industrial Emissions PortalClimate and energy in the EUCopernicus Land Monitoring ServiceCopernicus InSituTopicsAnalysis and dataCountriesNewsroomAbout usEuropean Environment Agency's home pageAir quality in EuropeThe\u00a0number of deaths in the EU\u00a0attributable to fine particulate matter fell by 45% between 2005 and 2022Read more in our press releaseImageValeria Vitulano, Urban Treasures / EEAWhat we doTogether with our Eionet network, we provide the knowledge and the data needed to achieve sustainability in Europe.We support policies with evidence-based knowledge to help the European Union and our member countries achieve sustainabilityWe build and maintain networks and partnerships to facilitate sharing of knowledge and expertise across EuropeWe inform public and policy discussions on sustainability solutions and challengesWe collect, quality check and disseminate data, making full use of digitalisation and latest innovative technologies  More about usThe EEA in briefThe\u00a0European Environment Agency in brief\u00a0presents our role as an agency that supports European environmental policy.Find out more about what we work on, our strategic priorities, our key outputs, our key services and publications, and what it\u2019s like to work at the EEA.Read \"The EEA in brief\"Time to speed up towards a sustainable and resilient EuropeEurope\u2019s economy and wellbeing of its citizens depend crucially on a healthy and resilient natural environment, a stable climate and long-term sustainable use of resources.
