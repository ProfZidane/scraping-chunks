{"content": "\u2018Impacts of air pollution on ecosystems in Europe\u2019, looks at how vegetation is exposed to key air pollutants and how this translates into crops yield and economic losses.The EEA briefing found that nitrogen in the air, which is deposited on ecosystems, increases the nutrient loading (eutrophication) leading to changes in the ecosystem structure and function (changes in plant species that can grow in an area). Notably, 73% of ecosystems in the EU were above critical loads for eutrophication in 2022.The zero pollution action plan includes the objective to reduce the area of ecosystems where nitrogen deposition exceeds critical loads by 25% by 2030 compared to the levels in 2005. This objective is currently unlikely to be met, as it fell by 13% between 2005 and 2022.Impacts of air pollution on ecosystems in EuropeAlso, about one third of Europe\u2019s agricultural lands were exposed to ground-level ozone concentrations above the threshold value set for protection of vegetation under EU rules."}
