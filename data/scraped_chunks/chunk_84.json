These include enhancing biological \r\nanthropogenic sinks of CO2 and using chemical engineering to achieve \r\nlong-term removal and storage. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from \r\nindustrial and energy-related sources, which alone does not remove CO2 \r\nfrom the atmosphere, can remove atmospheric CO2 if it is combined with \r\nbioenergy production (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture & Storage - \r\nBECCS).
