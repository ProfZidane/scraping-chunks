Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will have to accelerate to reach the 2030 milestone and the long-term goals. This website provides direct access to data and analysis on key areas for achieving climate neutrality, based mainly on official information submitted by European countries to the European Environment Agency.We need your feedback for this website\u2019s re-designDo you have 4 minutes to help us improve the Climate and Energy Website?

As a consequence, marine species and habitats are still not in good condition.The resilience of marine ecosystems against climate change makes a big contribution to that of the planet, but the ongoing pressures reduce this marine resilience.Responding to these challenges requires fundamental changes \rto make our society more sustainable than today Recently releasedETC/ICM Report.

How climate change impacts marine lifeThis briefing summarises some of the ways in which climate change is impacting Europe\u2019s marine ecosystems. It identifies how various ecosystem features are influenced by climate change and spotlights potential areas of concern.
