Another example, in \r\nthe context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, relates to the \r\nundertaking potentially relying on contingent labour with little to no \r\naccess to sick care and health benefits that may face severe operational\r\n and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep \r\nworking while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and \r\ncausing major\r\n                \n\r\n                  supply chain\r\n                 \n\r\n                breakdowns.
