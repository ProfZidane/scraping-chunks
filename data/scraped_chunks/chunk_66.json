{"content": "impacts on supply chains, distribution, and sales in a number of ways. Heat negatively affects human health and can lead to poorer work performance (reduced productivity) or lower numbers of hours committed to work (labour supply).Coastal areasSea level rise can cause flooding, coastal erosion and the loss of low-lying coastal systems. It will also increase the risk of storm surges and the likelihood of landward intrusion of saltwater and may endanger coastal ecosystems. Expected rises in water temperatures and ocean acidification will contribute to a restructuring of coastal ecosystems; with implications for ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycling.Cultural HeritageThe impacts of catastrophic events on this heritage are coupled with the slow onset of changes arising from deterioration processes. Continuous increase in temperature and fluctuations in temperature and humidity or fluctuations in freeze\u2013thaw cycles causes degradation and stress in materials, leading to a greater need"}
