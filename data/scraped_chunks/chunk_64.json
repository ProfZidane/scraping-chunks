For \r\nexample, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, \r\nundertakings that rely on contingent labour with little to no access to \r\nsick care and health benefits may face severe operational and business \r\ncontinuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while \r\nsick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major\r\n                \n\r\n                  supply chain\r\n                 \n\r\n                breakdowns.

Reputational and \r\nbusiness opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of low-skilled, \r\nlow-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protections for \r\nthem are also increasing with media backlash and\r\n                \n\r\n                  consumer\r\n                 \n\r\n                preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods.\r\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                 AR 8.\r\n                \n\n\n\n\r\n                Examples of particular characteristics of\r\n                \n\r\n                  value chain workers\r\n                 \n\r\n                that may be considered by the \r\nundertaking when responding to paragraph 12 relate to young workers that\r\n may be more susceptible to\r\n                \n\r\n                  impacts\r\n                 \n\r\n                on their physical and mental \r\ndevelopment, or women workers in a context where women are routinely \r\ndiscriminated against in the terms and conditions of work, or migrant \r\nworkers in a context where the market for the supply of labour is poorly\r\n regulated and workers are routinely charged recruitment fees. For some \r\nworkers, the inherent nature of the activity that they are required to \r\nundertake may put them at risk (e.g., workers required to handle \r\nchemicals or operate certain equipment or low paid workers who are on \r\n\u201czero hours\u201d contracts).\r\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                 AR 9.", "AR 9.\r\n                \n\n\n\n\r\n                With regard to paragraph 13, material risks could also arise because of the undertaking\u2019s dependency on\r\n                \n\r\n                  value chain workers\r\n                 \n\r\n                where low likelihood but high impact events may trigger\r\n                \n\r\n                  financial effects;\r\n                 \n\r\n                for example, where a global \r\npandemic leads to severe health impacts on workers at all stages of the \r\nvalue chain resulting in major disruptions to production and \r\ndistribution.
