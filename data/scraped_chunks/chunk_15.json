This appendix provides a non-binding illustration \r\nof the impact- and financial materiality assessment outlined in chapter \r\n3. IRO-1 in section 4.1 of ESRS 2 includes general disclosure \r\nrequirements (DR) about the undertaking\u2019s process to identify impacts, \r\nrisks and opportunities and assess their materiality. SBM-3 of ESRS 2 \r\nprovides general disclosures requirements on the material impact, risks \r\nand opportunities resulting from the undertaking\u2019s materiality \r\nassessment. The undertaking can omit all disclosure requirements in a \r\ntopical standard if it assessed that the topic in question is not \r\nmaterial. In that case it may disclose a brief explanation of the \r\nconclusions of the materiality assessment for that topic but\r\n            \r\n             shall\r\n            \r\n            disclose a detailed explanation in the case of ESRS E1 climate change \r\n(IRO-2 ESRS 2).
