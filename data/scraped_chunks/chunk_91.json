About the EEAThe European Environment Agency (EEA) is an agency of the European Union. Our task is to provide sound, reliable and independent information on the environment and climate. The regulation establishing the EEA was adopted by the EU in 1990, and the Agency started operations in Copenhagen in 1994. To support policymaking in Europe, we work closely with national and European institutions, in particular the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.
