The country-level \r\ndata shall then be added up to calculate total numbers, disregarding \r\ndifferences in national legal definitions. Non-guaranteed hours \r\nemployees are employed by the undertaking without a guarantee of a \r\nminimum or fixed number of working hours. The employee may need to make \r\nthemselves available for work as required, but the undertaking is not \r\ncontractually obliged to offer the employee a minimum or fixed number of\r\n working hours per day, week, or month.

For example, a high proportion of temporary or part-time \r\nemployees could indicate a lack of employment security for employees, \r\nbut it could equally signal workplace flexibility when offered as a \r\nvoluntary choice.

The \r\nundertaking can explain the reasons for temporary employment. An example\r\n of such a reason is the recruitment of employees to undertake work on a\r\n temporary or seasonal project or event. Another example is the standard\r\n practice of offering a temporary contract (for example, six months) to \r\nnew employees before an offer of permanent employment is made.
