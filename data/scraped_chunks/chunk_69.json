For \r\nexample, where the undertaking\u2019s strategy involves moving into higher \r\nrisk geographies in pursuit of certain commodities, and if affected \r\ncommunities resist its presence or object to its local practices, this \r\nmay create extensive and costly delays, and affect the undertaking\u2019s \r\nability to secure future land concessions or permits. Similarly, if the \r\nundertaking\u2019s business model relies on intensive water extraction at its\r\n plants, to the extent that it affects access to water for communities\u2019 \r\nconsumption, hygiene and livelihoods, this may result in \r\nreputationally-damaging boycotts, complaints and lawsuits.\r\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                 AR 7.", "AR 7.\r\n                \n\n\n\n\r\n                Examples of particular characteristics of\r\n                \n\r\n                  affected communities\r\n                 \n\r\n                that may be considered by the \r\nundertaking when responding to paragraph 10 may be an affected community\r\n that is physically or economically isolated and is particularly \r\nsusceptible to introduced diseases or has limited access to social \r\nservices and therefore relies on infrastructure set up by the \r\nundertaking. It may be because where land worked by women is purchased \r\nby the undertaking and payments go to male heads of households, women \r\nbecome further disenfranchised in the community.

In addition, \r\nthe undertaking shall consider whether different characteristics \r\noverlap. For example, characteristics such as ethnicity, socioeconomic \r\nstatus, migrant status and gender may create overlapping risks of harm \r\nfor certain affected communities, or for distinct parts of those \r\naffected communities, since affected communities are often heterogeneous\r\n in nature.\r\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                 AR 8.\r\n                \n\n\n\n\r\n                With regard to paragraph 11, material risks could also arise because of the undertaking\u2019s dependency on\r\n                \n\r\n                  affected communities\r\n                 \n\r\n                where low likelihood but high impact events may trigger\r\n                \n\r\n                  financial effects;\r\n                 \n\r\n                for example, where a natural \r\ndisaster leads to a catastrophic industrial accident involving the \r\nundertaking\u2019s operations, resulting in severe harm to affected \r\ncommunities.\r\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            Impact, risk and opportunity management\r\n           \n\n\n\n\r\n             Disclosure Requirement S3-1 \u2013 Policies related to affected communities\r\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                 AR 9.\r\n                \n\n\n\n\r\n                The description shall include the key information necessary to ensure a faithful representation of the policies in relation to\r\n                \n\r\n                  affected communities\r\n                 \n\r\n                and, therefore, the undertaking\r\n shall consider explanations of significant changes to the policies \r\nadopted during the reporting year (for example, new or additional \r\napproaches to engagement, due diligence and remedy).\r\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                 AR 10.", "AR 10.\r\n                \n\n\n\n\r\n                When disclosing the alignment of its\r\n policies with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, \r\nthe undertaking shall consider that the Guiding Principles refer to the \r\nInternational Bill of Rights, which consists of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the two Covenants that implement it, as \r\nwell as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the \r\nInternational Labour Organisation\u2019s Convention concerning Indigenous and\r\n Tribal Peoples (ILO No. 169) and the core conventions that underpin it,\r\n and may disclose its alignment with these instruments.\r\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                 AR 11.\r\n                \n\n\n\n\r\n                The undertaking may provide an \r\nillustration of the types of communication of its policies to those \r\nindividuals, group of individuals or entities for whom they are \r\nrelevant, either because they are expected to implement them (for \r\nexample, the undertaking\u2019s\r\n                \n\r\n                  employees\r\n                 \n\r\n                , contractors and\r\n                \n\r\n                  suppliers\r\n                 \n\r\n                ), or because they have a direct\r\n interest in their implementation (for example, own workers, investors).\r\n It may disclose communication tools and channels (for example, flyers, \r\nnewsletters, dedicated websites, social media, face to face \r\ninteractions, workers\u2019 representatives), aimed at ensuring that the\r\n                \n\r\n                  policy\r\n                 \n\r\n                is accessible and that \r\ndifferent audiences understand its implications.
