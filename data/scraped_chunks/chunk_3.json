This overview is updated upon an IFRS Standard or IFRS Intepretation being issued by the IASB, EFRAG issuing its draft and final endorsement advice, and the ARC voting in favour of endorsement. It includes mention of the IASB effective date, an indication of when the various decisions, including final endorsement, are expected to be made and of whether the time-table is compatible with the IASB effective date.  The report further contains a list of all IFRS, amendments to IFRS and IFRS Interpretations endorsed in the EU, providing for each of them the date when it became effective in the EU, the date the endorsement decision was made and the date when it was published in the Official Journal of the European Union.Download the latest reportView the latest update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nVacancies and tenders\nWe regularly advertise job openings for a wide variety of support, professional and leadership roles.\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEFRAG (IVZW/AISBL)35 Square de Mee\u00fbs1000 Brussels (fifth floor)BELGIUMT +32 (0)2 207 93 00How to reach usEuropean Transparency Register: 411098519407-76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Subscribe to our newsletter\n            \n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\nMain navigation\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\nFinancial reporting", "Subscribe to our newsletter\n            \n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\nMain navigation\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\nFinancial reporting\n\n\nSustainability reporting\n\n\nEFRAG update\n\n\nNews and calendar\n\n\nOpen consultations\n\n\nVacancy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Connect with us\n            \n\n\nYoutube \n\n\nTwitter \n\n\nLinkedin \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom menu\n\n\n\u00a9 EFRAG\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\nCookie statement\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\n\nDMS menu\n\n\nSite by D\u2019M&S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain navigation\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\nAbout EFRAG\n\n\nWorking groups and advisory panels\n\n\nAnnual reviews\n\n\nFriends of EFRAG\n\n\nLegal & Policies\n\n\nOur structure and member organisations\n\n\nAll EFRAG projects\n\n\n\n\nFinancial reporting\n\n\nAbout financial reporting and due process\n\n\nEndorsement status\n\n\nMeetings\n\n\nNews\n\n\nProjects\n\n\nConnectivity between FR and SR\n\n\nGovernance and technical bodies\n\n\nOpen consultations\n\n\n\n\nSustainability reporting\n\n\nAbout sustainability reporting and due process\n\n\nESRS workstreams\n\n\nESRS Q&A platform\n\n\nMeetings\n\n\nNews\n\n\nProjects\n\n\nConnectivity between FR and SR\n\n\nGovernance and technical bodies\n\n\nOpen consultations\n\n\n\n\nEFRAG update\n\n\nNews and calendar\n\n\nNews\n\n\nMeetings calendar\n\n\nIFASS meetings\n\n\nSustainability Reporting Publications \n\n\nFinancial Reporting Publications\n\n\n\n\nOpen consultations\n\n\nVacancy\n\n\n\n\nUser account menu\n\n\nLog in\n\n\nWebsite feedback\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nContact us", "European Climate and Health ObservatorySkip to main contentSkip to navigationSkip to footerAn official website of the European Union | How do you know?All official European Union website addresses are in the europa.eu domain.See all EU institutions and bodiesEnvironmental information systemsEuropean Environment Agency websiteWISE marine - Marine information system for EuropeWISE freshwater - Freshwater information system for EuropeBISE - Biodiversity information system for EuropeFISE - Forest information system for EuropeEuropean Climate and health observatoryClimateADAPTEuropean Industrial Emissions PortalClimate and energy in the EUCopernicus Land Monitoring ServiceCopernicus InSituENEnglishENDeutschDEFran\u00e7aisFREspa\u00f1olESItalianoITPolskiPLAboutPolicy contextEvidence on climate change and healthPublications and outreachEuropean Climate and Health ObservatoryWe provide easy access to a wide range of relevant tools, data and other resources related to climate change and health, with the aim to support Europe in becoming resilient to the health impacts of climate change.DISCOVER THE MAIN TOPICS AND TOOLS OF THE OBSERVATORY1Case studies2Indicators3Country profiles4Resource catalogue5Map viewersCase studies showcase implemented initiatives in Europe that build resilience against health risks induced by climate changeExplore all case studiesProtecting surface water quality in FinlandMental health support for flooded populations in ItalyDrought insurance for farmers in AustriaMore than 20 indicators from trusted information providers offer information on climate and healthConsult all indicatorsno resultsCountry profiles describe how EEA member countries address climate change adaptation in (sub)national public health policies and how they cover public health aspects in climate change adaptation strategies and plansView country profilesThe resource catalogue is a database of quality checked resourcesAccess the catalogueno resultsMap viewers allow to assess the spatial distribution of climate-related health risks, impacts, exposure and responses across EuropeExplore more map viewersExposure of vulnerable groupsDistribution of urban green spaceAccessibility of hospitals in EuropeNEW IN THE OBSERVATORYEEA briefing on the impacts of heat on health: Surveillance and preparedness in EuropeOf all weather-and climate-related extreme events in Europe, heat causes the largest number of deaths.
