{"content": "ecosystems in EuropeAlso, about one third of Europe\u2019s agricultural lands were exposed to ground-level ozone concentrations above the threshold value set for protection of vegetation under EU rules. This resulted in crop damage, reduced yields and estimated economic losses of at least \u20ac2 billion. Ozone damages forests and plants by reducing growth rates, lowering yields, and affecting biodiversity. In 2022, 62% of the total forest area in the 32 EEA member countries exceeded critical levels set to protect forests from ozone. Significant decreases in emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2) over recent decades have mostly addressed the problem of acidification.Background The EEA briefings: \u2018Harm to human health from air pollution in Europe: burden of disease status 2024\u2019 and the \u2018Impacts of air pollution on ecosystems in Europe\u2019, are part of the EEA's air quality in Europe 2024 package. The EEA has been estimating number of deaths attributable to exposure to air pollution since 2014. The EEA"}
